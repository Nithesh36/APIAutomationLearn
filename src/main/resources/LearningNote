Put  needs to Remember:
O A HTTP request method to update or create a resource
● It replaces the current representation of the a resource
with the new request payload if resource is found
● If resource is not found on server, PUT should be capable
to create a new resource
● Idempotent  if we send any payload  invalid new resource will be created so memory will be waste   it is called Idempotent 
and it will not compare new changes made or not it will just hit and create resource
O Not a safe method
● 201, 200 or 204 status code



The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under
the supplied Request-URI.
If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the
enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the
one residing on the origin server.
If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that
URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting
user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.
If a new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user
agent via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is
modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes
SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.
If the resource could not be created or modified with the Request
URI, an appropriate error response SHOULD be given that reflects
the nature of the problem.
